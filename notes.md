1. Don't confuse identifier and label.
2. Don't confuse search and retrieval.

4. Editing and reading texts are different interpretive activities.
5. Scholarly work is version controlled.
6. Scholarly work is licensed for scholarly reuse.
7. User interfaces are emphemeral; services have lengthier lives, but simple archival data formats are the key to long-term preservation.
8. Make your computational environment replicable.
9. Every assertion must have an accompanying test.
8. The purpose of studying digital humanities is **not** to create better *digital* scholarship:  it is to create better *technology-independent* scholarlship.
