A few things that you need to understand about digital scholarship  before starting work on a project.


##The purpose of digital scholarship

- The purpose of studying digital humanities is **not** to create better *digital* scholarship:  it is to create better *technology-independent* scholarship.


## Digital scholarship in the scholarly community ##

- Scholarly work is licensed for scholarly reuse.
- Make your computational environment replicable.

## Practical management and architecture ##


- Scholarly work is version controlled.  Track changes and know what version of material you're talking about.
- User interfaces are ephemeral; services have lengthier lives, but simple archival data formats are the key to long-term preservation.


## Argument and demonstration

- Every assertion must have an accompanying test.
- Scholarly citation of evidence is declarative, not procedural: don't confuse retrieval and search.
- Cite evidence with  identifiers, not labels.

## Digital reading and editing ##

- Editing and reading texts are different interpretive activities.  Don't complicate your edition with analytical markup.
